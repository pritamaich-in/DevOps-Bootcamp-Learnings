- Terraform is used to monitor changes , earlier if some changes are made in aws like changing instance type or any other thing it was not monitored but with terraform it is monitored and chances of making mistakes are reduced.
- for eg. we want to make 15 same instance types in different regions it will be difficult to do this manually but with terraform it is done easily.
- Terraform is a declarative tool.
- Declarative tool vs Imperative tool
- COMMANDS:
    - terraform init // done only once
    - terraform plan
    - terraform apply
- Terragrunt helps you to work with terraform configuration.
