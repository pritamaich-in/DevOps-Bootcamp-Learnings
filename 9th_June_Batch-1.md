## About EC2
- In EC2 instance when you give a name, a tag is added by AWS with key:Name and Value:the name you gave.
- AWS has its own Linux created using CentOS
- Anyone can create image AMI(Amazon Machine Image) upload it on AWS for people to use.
- AMI is different from Docker image. Docker Images are very light and AMI are heavy.
- Instance type basically tells about the generation of the hardware being used. Read more about it on https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
- Note: If a t type instance is running but is idle i.e., CPU is not being used, you earn some credits from AWS. And if in future you require more than 1 CPU, AWS uses these credits for providing those CPU..that is you don't have to pay for those extra CPU's.
