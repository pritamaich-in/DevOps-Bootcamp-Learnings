## Linux Commands
- use 'sh' command then use 'exit' to come out of it: while you're using 'sh' you can't tell by just looking in which directory you're present; you'll have to use pwd for it. 
- use 'cd /etc' to see the files inside it
- use 'cd /dev' and using ls see the files inside it.
- first character tells about file type example b stands for block type  of file and if its only - then it is regular file; block file is a unique type of file and we don't open it just like a regular file.
- 3 important files: 
- 'l' stands for link files; we have hard and soft links in linux; 
- every file in linux has owner and group
- Standard strings is easy way in linux to understand a program and give input and output. example stderr, stdin, stdout.
- command which explicitly tells if command is successfully executed or not: echo $?    ;here ? contains exit code of previos command. if it gives 0 then successfully executed command otherwise 1.
- folder /proc contains all the information of processes running in the system.
