- what is System log?
- What are system calls and system calls are made?

## Linux Commands
- use 'sh' command then use 'exit' to come out of it: while you're using 'sh' you can't tell by just looking in which directory you're present; you'll have to use pwd for it. 
- use 'cd /etc' to see the files inside it
- use 'cd /dev' and using ls see the files inside it.
- first character tells about file type example b stands for block type  of file and if its only - then it is regular file; block file is a unique type of file and we don't open it just like a regular file. Next column indicates the permissions of user and the group to which the user belongs to.
- 3 important files: 
- a) stderr
- b) stdin
- c) stdout
- 'l' stands for link files; we have hard and soft links in linux; 
- every file in linux has owner and group
- Root user is the owner of all the files in linux by default.
- Standard strings is an easy way in linux to understand a program and give input and output. example stderr, stdin, stdout.
- command which explicitly tells if the recently executed command is successfully executed or not: echo $?    ;where ? contains exit code of previos command. if it gives 0 then successfully executed command otherwise 1.
- Everything in linux is a file or process.
- folder /proc contains all the information of processes running in the system. Change your directory to 'cd /proc' and execute the command ls to know the process id(PID) of the running processes, system information and the associated resources with eaxh process.
- Some important directories :-  
- a) /etc
- b) /dev
- c) /home
- d) /proc
- Use cd or cd ~ to move to root directory.
- Concept of absolute and relative path.
