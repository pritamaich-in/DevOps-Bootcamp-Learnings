## DOCKER
- Docker has 4 objects :- 
  - 1. Docker containers
  - 2. Docker Images
  - 3. Docker network
  - 4. Docker volume

### Virtualization 
- With BARE METAL SYSTEMS where every application runs on a single machine, it requires neccessary dependencies, libraries etc to run successfully. If any of the insatlled library breaks, entire system collapse and we need to install the OS Server again.
